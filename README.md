A. Introduction

A.1. Description

Food and drink venues are a big trend in Toronto. According to toronto.ca, the city has more than 7 thousand licensed and non-licensed units and this number keeps growing. However, the number of places closing their doors is also high. What is the secret behind that? Why in the same neighborhood some places have such a high demand while there are others hardly getting any profit? The objective of the following analysis is to check weather or not a specific kind of venue would be popular in a determined neighborhood, and which neighborhood has a better acceptance for that kind. Making this analysis very interesting for those who are looking to open their new business in any Toronto area. For this analysis, I will be using a coffee related shop as an example.

A.2. Data Description

Considering this problem, the following data was used:
- From Wikipedia, I have found a complete list of postal codes of Toronto, followed by theirs borough and neighborhood name. [1]
- I used the Foursquare API to explore the top venues of a given neighborhood. [2]
